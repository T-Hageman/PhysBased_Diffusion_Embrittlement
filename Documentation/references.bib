abstract = {We present a gradient-based theoretical framework for predicting hydrogen assisted fracture in elastic-plastic solids. The novelty of the model lies in the combination of: (i) stress-assisted diffusion of solute species, (ii) strain gradient plasticity, and (iii) a hydrogen-sensitive phase field fracture formulation, inspired by first principles calculations. The theoretical model is numerically implemented using a mixed finite element formulation and several boundary value problems are addressed to gain physical insight and showcase model predictions. The results reveal the critical role of plastic strain gradients in rationalising decohesion-based arguments and capturing the transition to brittle fracture observed in hydrogen-rich environments. Large crack tip stresses are predicted, which in turn raise the hydrogen concentration and reduce the fracture energy. The computation of the steady state fracture toughness as a function of the cohesive strength shows that cleavage fracture can be predicted in otherwise ductile metals using sensible values for the material parameters and the hydrogen concentration. In addition, we compute crack growth resistance curves in a wide variety of scenarios and demonstrate that the model can appropriately capture the sensitivity to: the plastic length scales, the fracture length scale, the loading rate and the hydrogen concentration. Model predictions are also compared with fracture experiments on a modern ultra-high strength steel, AerMet100. A promising agreement is observed with experimental measurements of threshold stress intensity factor Kth over a wide range of applied potentials.},

Furthermore, a finite element formulation based on our mathematical model is presented. Finally, using the distribution of the interionic flux density and an energy dissipation function, we show that besides properly capturing flow due to ionic interactions, our model can also describe independent ionic flow as predicted by the conventional Nernst-Planck equation in regions where ionic interactions are weak. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase-field. In this paper, we outline a thermodynamically consistent framework for phase-field models of crack propagation in elastic solids, develop incremental variational principles and consider their numerical implementations by multi-field finite element methods. We start our investigation with an intuitive and descriptive derivation of a regularized crack surface functional that $\Gamma$-converges for vanishing length-scale parameter to a sharp crack topology functional. This functional provides the basis for the definition of suitable convex dissipation functions that govern the evolution of the crack phase-field. Here, we propose alternative rate-independent and viscous over-force models that ensure the local growth of the phase-field. Next, we define an energy storage function whose positive tensile part degrades with increasing phase-field. With these constitutive functionals at hand, we derive the coupled balances of quasi-static stress equilibrium and gradient-type phase-field evolution in the solid from the argument of virtual power. Here, we consider a canonical two-field setting for rate-independent response and a time-regularized three-field formulation with viscous over-force response. It is then shown that these balances follow as the Euler equations of incremental variational principles that govern the multi-field problems. These principles make the proposed formulation extremely compact and provide a perfect base for the finite element implementation, including features such as the symmetry of the monolithic tangent matrices. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed phase-field formulations of fracture by means of representative numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

For the temporal discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic and staggered time integration scheme.

Several more complex examples solved with the finite element method demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the effect of cracking on the local and on the macroscopically measured diffusivities.

abstract = {Phase-field models for fracture have gained exceptional popularity in the last couple of decades and have been extended into areas well beyond brittle quasi-static fracture propagation to ductile, dynamic, or hydraulic fracturing. Despite the significant theoretical advancements in these more complex physical settings, little attention has been paid to the quantification of crack opening displacement to date as most applications do not explicitly require the crack opening displacement for the morphological evolution of cracks. However, one of the exemptions would be hydraulic fracturing where the crack propagation is driven by the fluid pressure which strongly depends on the crack opening displacement. In this study, we look into two known approaches, a line integral and a level-set method, for crack opening computation mainly from an implementation point of view. Firstly, we derive an approximation of a discontinuous function field in the variational phase-field setting which is then applied to obtain the crack opening (displacement jump) and verify the approximation against a closed solution. We then propose a “certain distance from the crack” required for the level-set function using a one-dimensional analysis. Finally, we compare these approaches under several different conditions such as crack alignment to the mesh or under loading (asymmetric displacement field) and investigate the convergence with respect to the mesh size.},

In this paper, we derive a unified fracture–porous medium hydraulic fracturing model, leveraging the inherent ability of the variational phase-field approach to fracture to handle multiple cracks interacting and evolving along complex yet, critically, unspecified paths. The fundamental principle driving the crack evolution is an energetic criterion derived from Griffith's theory. The originality of this approach is that the crack path itself is derived from energy minimization instead of additional branching criterion. The numerical implementation is based on a regularization approach similar to a phase-field model, where the cracks location is represented by a smooth function defined on a fixed mesh. The derived model shows how the smooth fracture field can be used to model fluid flow in a fractured porous medium. We verify the proposed approach in a simple idealized scenario where closed form solutions exist in the literature. We then demonstrate the new method's capabilities in more realistic situations where multiple fractures turn, interact, and in some cases, merge with other fractures.},
