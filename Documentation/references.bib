@article{Oriani1974,
abstract = {The threshold pressures, p*, of hydrogen and of deuterium gases necessary to cause crack propagation in AISI 4340 steel of 250 ksi yield strength have been determined as functions of plane-strain stressintensity factor K at room temperature. The functional p*(K) is shown to be well fitted by an analytical expression derived from the unstable equilibrium form of the decohesion theory plus some reasonable ad hoc assumptions for the necessary functional relationships. From the fitting of the theoretical equation to the experimental data are obtained numerical values for the hydrostatic component of stress at the crack front, for the equilibrium enhancement of concentration of hydrogen, and for the reduction by the hydrogen of the maximum cohesive resistive force. The magnitudes of these numbers and their trends with K are in agreement with expectations from the decohesion theory but with no other extant point of view. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

@article{Martinez-Paneda2020,
abstract = {We present a generalised framework for resolving the electrochemistry-diffusion interface and modelling hydrogen transport near a crack tip. The adsorption and absorption kinetics are captured by means of Neumann-type generalised boundary conditions. The diffusion model includes the role of trapping, with a constant or evolving trap density, and the influence of the hydrostatic stress. Both conventional plasticity and strain gradient plasticity are used to model the mechanical behaviour of the solid. Notable differences are found in the estimated crack tip hydrogen concentrations when comparing with the common procedure of prescribing a constant hydrogen concentration at the crack surfaces.},

@article{Kristensen2020a,
abstract = {We present a gradient-based theoretical framework for predicting hydrogen assisted fracture in elastic-plastic solids. The novelty of the model lies in the combination of: (i) stress-assisted diffusion of solute species, (ii) strain gradient plasticity, and (iii) a hydrogen-sensitive phase field fracture formulation, inspired by first principles calculations. The theoretical model is numerically implemented using a mixed finite element formulation and several boundary value problems are addressed to gain physical insight and showcase model predictions. The results reveal the critical role of plastic strain gradients in rationalising decohesion-based arguments and capturing the transition to brittle fracture observed in hydrogen-rich environments. Large crack tip stresses are predicted, which in turn raise the hydrogen concentration and reduce the fracture energy. The computation of the steady state fracture toughness as a function of the cohesive strength shows that cleavage fracture can be predicted in otherwise ductile metals using sensible values for the material parameters and the hydrogen concentration. In addition, we compute crack growth resistance curves in a wide variety of scenarios and demonstrate that the model can appropriately capture the sensitivity to: the plastic length scales, the fracture length scale, the loading rate and the hydrogen concentration. Model predictions are also compared with fracture experiments on a modern ultra-high strength steel, AerMet100. A promising agreement is observed with experimental measurements of threshold stress intensity factor Kth over a wide range of applied potentials.},

The coupled deformation-diffusion-damage model presented enables predicting fatigue crack nucleation and growth for arbitrary loading patterns and specimen geometries. The role of hydrogen in increasing fatigue crack growth rates and decreasing the number of cycles to failure is investigated. Our numerical experiments enable mapping the three loading frequency regimes and naturally recover Paris law behaviour for various hydrogen concentrations. In addition, Virtual S-N curves are obtained for both notched and smooth samples, exhibiting a good agreement with experiments.},

@article{Sarkar2011,
abstract = {We propose a simple, but novel mathematical and numerical approach to describe mass transport in dilute solutions, taking into consideration ionic interactions. Our proposed approach treats fluxes due to ionic interactions as additional unknowns in the transport equation. Through variational arguments, we derive a simple expression for these ionic fluxes in terms of the electroneutrality condition, which allows for a straightforward treatment of the new unknowns. Furthermore, a finite element formulation based on our mathematical model is presented. Finally, using the distribution of the interionic flux density and an energy dissipation function, we show that besides properly capturing flow due to ionic interactions, our model can also describe independent ionic flow as predicted by the conventional Nernst-Planck equation in regions where ionic interactions are weak. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
